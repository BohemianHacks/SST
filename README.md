Shell Stock Ticker

Small utility to monitor stocks. Still under development and potentially buggy.

Project is on a minor hold while I catch up on classwork.

Removed the main utility app until yfinance api is more finalized.



TODO:

Clean up sorting methods

-Plan to implement a single property to index map. This will allow a single lookup of a property when sorting.

Switch to YQL interface for pulling data

-CSV API has unescaped commas in ASK_SIZE and BID_SIZE
